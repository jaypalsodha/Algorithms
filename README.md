Understanding algorithms and Data Structure.

# Insertion Sort
 - In place algorithm
 - O(n2) Complexity - Quadratic
 - It will take 100 steps to sort 10 elements, or 10,000 steps to sort 100 elements.
 
 Understanding the algorithm
 
| index-0 |index-1 | index-2|index-3|index-4|index-5| 
| --------| -------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 35      | 25     |10      |7      |  8    |31     |

 - Making first element as sorted element i.e sorted element at index -0
 - Keeping firstUnsort element to a element at first index. i.e 25
 - Comparing elements from right to left and swaping elemnts based on their value.
